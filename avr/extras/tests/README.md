# Minimum functionality tests

The tests in this folder each check one particular basic functionality. They are organized in folders, where each folder contains at least a target sketch, which needs to be flashed to the target chip, and perhaps a host sketch for an ATmega328P (Uno, Mega, or Nano). Further, there will be a generic description of how to wire up the two sketches and how to run the test protocol.
